# Oslosykkel

Oslosykkel is a hobby project that uses data from the bikesharing schemes in Oslo, Bergen and Trondheim to show both the location of stations as well as the availability of bikes and locks at each station. The project uses Vue, Node and Leaflet.js as its main frameworks and libraries.

## Run the project
The code can be run in developer mode by first starting and express server using `node server.js` to start the express server that is proxying the data provided by the bike sharing schemes. Then run `npm run serve` in order to start the Vue app in dev mode.
